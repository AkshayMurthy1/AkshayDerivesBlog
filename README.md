Welcome to AkshayDerivesBlog, a personal collection of blog posts where I dive into math, physics, machine learning, and other topics that fascinate me. This space is meant to help me think out loud, share intuitive explanations, and connect ideas that Iâ€™m exploring or building. Feedback is always welcome; please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request or email me @akshaymurthy08@gmail.com
